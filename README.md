## What is Pomodoro Technique®?

According to [the official website](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/):

    The Pomodoro Technique® is a way to get the most out of time management.
    Turn time into a valuable ally to accomplish what we want to do and chart
    continuous improvement in the way we do it.

## What does Tomato provide?

1. A simple TODO list. Your data is stored inside LocalStorage of your browser
   (if it supports LocalStorage). Future versions may provide REAL web backends
   to sync data to.
1. A Pomodoro timer that follows that Pomodoro workflow. (However) Current version
   hasn't implemented "interruptions" and "unexpected events" yet.

## How do I use it?

Visit [Tomato's Github Page](http://iwinux.github.com/tomato), and the rest is straightforward.
